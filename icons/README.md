# Icons
A lot of these icons are taken from [skillicons.dev](https://skillicons.dev/). That website has many great looking icons and very good explanations on how to use them on their [GitHub](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons/tree/main). Nevertheless, I wanted to make some icons that are very specific to my page so I decided to save the images here.

## Icon factory
As I wanted to make my own icons, I created a python script to create the SVG icon files. Note that the quality is not perfect so any suggestions would be very much appreciated!

### Usage
To run the python script make sure you have `pillow` installed.
```bash
pip install pillow
```
The script accepts images in the `icons/factory/images_to_convert/` subfolder and then saves the icons in the `icons/` folder.
